If you have a dropout during a game, and are sure you must replace them, then ask in the chat.

			The Sunless Cell
      <br>Modifiers
      <br>Epic - Heavily shielded and highly aggressive enemies appear in great numbers.
      <br>Berserk - Minions of the Darkness won't flinch, even after massive damage
      <br>Small arms - Primary weapon damage is favored (increased primary damage, reduced special and heavy damage)
      <br>Chaff - Player radar is disabled
      <br>Airborne - Players deal more damage while in the air. Note that airborne activates when the damage is done and not when you shoot (relevant for rockets, grenades, etc).

			Welcome to our group. We are an admittedly small group of individuals who enjoy video games and (mostly) enjoy each others company. We don't have too many requirements here, just try to be nice and enjoy yourself.<br><br>
			Most of us are fairly active in chat, so if you're running late to a game or need someone to fill in, try to say something in chat and let everyone know.<br><br>
			If you make a session and for some reason aren't able to make it, don't worry about deleting it, just drop out and make someone else leader. Most people will still want to play it and someone else will probably join up.<br>
